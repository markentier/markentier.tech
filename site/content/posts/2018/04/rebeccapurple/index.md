While polishing my theme, I discovered Rebecca. I love it, when technology gets some human touch.

I was just reading about the color data type in CSS [over at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) when I saw that a new named color will be part of the [CSS Color Module Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/).

There was a link to [this Codepen blog post](https://codepen.io/trezy/post/honoring-a-great-man).

Rebecca was Eric Meyer's daughter. She was diagnosed with cancer. [On her sixth birthday she left us.](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/09/in-memoriam-2/)

> This past Friday, June 19th, 2014, the community to which Eric has given so very much [has seen fit to name #663399 as rebeccapurple](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Jun/0312.html) with his permission.

Eric Meyer is probably most well-known for [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
