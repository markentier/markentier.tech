Someone regularly reminds me of this fact. So that I do not forget, I write it down.

{{ quoted(body="Did you know that Rust is consistently voted the most popular language on Stack Overflow for 5 years?", source="Flo") }}

Yes, Flo, I do know, thanks to you. 😉

`2021-01` Flo is a prophet, he predicts that it will also be true for the sixth year in a row. Yet I will hold back with updating this post until the 2021 survey was conducted and evaluated.

_The reason for this running gag is that there are also a lot of blog posts and articles out there just stating the same fact without really providing much more value. The Rust community and surrounding observers never get tired to parrot the same phrase into pure meaninglessness. The only way to take it is with humor, of course, similar to what we experienced with the »Rust Evangelist Strike Force« (R.E.S.F.), a group which wants to port everything to Rust. For some folks I'm probably considered to be part of it._ 🤷🏻‍♂
