The average life span of a human is around 80 years. Today marks my halftime. I have no freaking clue what to do with that second half. No plot twist here.

<!-- more -->

To be honest, before I hit 20 I didn't even expect to ever get twice as old then. So technically I'm dead already according to my own prediction. Well, screw you past me, I outlived your expections.

So I'm an adult now. I should know now how this whole life thing works, right? Wrong again.

Maybe I get a better idea of it in my second half of life. Maybe never. And it probably doesn't matter anyway.

Time for some good old midlife crisis … [^mc]

<!-- footnotes -->

[^mc]: The phenomenon is described as a psychological crisis brought about by events that highlight a person's growing age, inevitable mortality, and possibly lack of accomplishments in life. This may produce feelings of intense depression, remorse, and high levels of anxiety, or the desire to achieve youthfulness or make drastic changes to their current lifestyle or feel the wish to change past decisions and events. — <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife_crisis>
