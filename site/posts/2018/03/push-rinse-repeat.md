I haven't bootstrapped a blog or static site for quite some time.

With a service like netlify this becomes kind of a bearable task.

And since this site hasn't seen much popularity yet—it just exists for less than 24 hours—I can even play this game live and in production.
Like the good old PHP-FTP times.

For fun I added already some meta tags for social media consumption like Twitter.

It should look like the article image.

This is just the second pretty useless post, but I think this is not so unusal for new blogs.
Bear with me, actual content will follow. Hence this new site. ;-)
